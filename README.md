> Although `RSS-Feed` is a complete project, several microservices are also implemented so it can be deployed with in multiple services.

This microservice is responsible to handle `Podcasts API` section of the `RSS-Feed`.

- Episodes list and details
- Subscribe and unsibscribe podcasts
- Like and unlike episodes

## Setup

Docker file to start the project is placed inside the main repo directory. Though it's better to read more about how to deploy all `RSS-Feed` microservices together in [RSS-Feed docs](https://github.com/Ramin-RX7/RSS-Feed/tree/develop/docs/microservices/README.md).
